# Scope

The FDC3 Standard specifies protocols and taxonomies to enable applications in financial services workflows to interoperate in a plug-and-play fashion, without prior bi-lateral agreements between app developers.

Financial applications include any type of application used in common financial workflows, including:

* Containerized Web applications - Interoperability platforms extending Chromium (e.g. Electron, OpenFin, interop.io's io.Connect)
* PWAs & Web applications running in a commercial browser
* Traditional native applications implemented in C++, .NET, Java, Python, etc.
* Hybrid web/native applications - stand alone native apps embedding a WebView (e.g. Electron, CEF, WebView2, NW.js etc.)
* Common desktop applications not specific to finance, but critical to workflows - such as Excel, Outlook, Slack, etc.

This standards group is focused specifically on establishing and promoting standards for the interoperability of front-end applications, hence, its activities are focused on:

* The discovery, configuration, identity and use of financial services applications (e.g. the FDC3 [App Directory](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/app-directory/overview)),
* APIs for communication and interaction between applications (e.g. the [Desktop Agent API](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/spec) and [Agent Bridging API](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/agent-bridging/spec)),
* Message formats used for communication (e.g. [Context Data](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/context/spec))
* Names for requested functionality and workflow steps (e.g. [Intents](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/intents/spec))
* Creating and promoting tests for conformance to these standards (e.g. the FDC3 Conformance Framework) and training & certification programs that relate to them (e.g. [Introduction to FDC3](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/express-learning/introduction-to-fdc3-lfel1000/))


The group's activities do not include:

* Interoperability or communication between back-end platforms.
* Defining financial objects - where existing standards are well established and can be reused.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
