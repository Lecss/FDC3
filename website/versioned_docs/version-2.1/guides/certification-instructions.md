    <div className="slide-notes">
      <p>This exam is <strong>proctored</strong>.  This means someone will be observing you (via webcam) take the exam.  For this reason, scheduling the exam is slightly complex.  These instructions will take you through the process. </p>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Some people find the proctoring process quite intrusive, howerver, we believe <strong>preparation is key:</strong> you will need to clear your desk, and install software on your machine (see below).</p>
      <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:help@finos.org?subject=Certification%20Feedback&body=Please%20let%20us%20know%20if%20you%20experience%20any%20difficulties%20with%20scheduling%20or%20taking%20the%20exam%3A">FINOS Help</a> if you have a bad experience and want to feedback about this.</p>

      <p>As evidenced by the length of these instructions, the process for taking the exam is quite involved.</p>
      <p>As a beta tester, we would like you to <strong>take notes on the process</strong> so we can improve it.</p>

      <p>We are very interested in knowing if you have problems with the process and are interested in improving it for test takers after the beta period.</p>

    <div className="slide-notes">
      <p>Next, you should see a greyed-out schedule box.  The exam is run by another firm, <a href="https://www.psiexams.com/test-sponsors/test-delivery/online-proctoring/">PSI</a>, and it can take up to 30 minutes to get the details of the candidate over to them.  So the button to schedule remains greyed out for usually a few minutes. </p>

      <p>Choose the location you are in.  There should be timeslots available in every location.</p>
      <p>As mentioned above, try to schedule the exam for a time when you'll be on your home equipment as it may not work inside a firewall.</p>      
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The beta for FCFP ends on 20th November 2023, so you must schedule by 19th November to have your answers included in the beta.</p>

    <div className="slide-notes">
      <p>To cut down on the chance of third parties trying to steal the exam questions, PSI uses it's own browser for the exam process.  You'll need to install this.</p>
    </div>

  <div className="slide slide--bordered">
    <div className="slide-image">
      <img src="/certification/20-popups.png" alt="Image of slide number 14" />

      <img src="/certification/21-install.png" alt="Image of slide number 14" />

    <div className="slide-notes">
      <p>To prevent cheating, the exam proctor will be able to view your screen while you take the exam.  So, you'll need to allow the <strong>PSI Browser</strong> to screen-record, much like Zoom does.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="slide slide--bordered">
    <div className="slide-image">
      <img src="/certification/23-running-apps.png" alt="Image of slide number 14" />
    </div>
    <div className="slide-notes">
      <p>Although you are above reproach, there is a cottage industry around cheating on exams, so as a further anti-cheating method, PSI will require you to shut down other programs running on your machine.  The next part is therefore a step to make sure this happens.</p>

    </div>
    <div className="slide-notes">
      <p>Next comes the exam <strong>admission</strong> process.  Follow the proctor's instructions and be ready to <strong>show the proctor around your room</strong>.  You'll need to demonstrate that your environment is set up correctly, as described above.</p>
      <p>You can then take the exam.  </p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> preserve 30 minutes of your time for reviewing your answers at the end.</p>
